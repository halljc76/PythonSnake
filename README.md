# PythonSnake

Project using the pygame library to create a 2D Snake game. Created Jun 19, 2020.
Note: This is my first attempt at a project using Classes in Python.

Guide to the files:
- apple, sky, side, ground, snakeHead.png are the images for the game.
- game (Intro screen and main loop), button (button object class), gamePlay.py (handles the gameplay within the main loop) are the files containing necessary code;
the main file is game.py.
